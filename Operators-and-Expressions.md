# üìò Operators and Expressions in C#

Understanding operators and expressions is crucial for performing calculations, making decisions, and manipulating data in C#. This chapter will cover various operators and how to use them effectively. Let's dive in! üöÄ

## What are Operators? üõ†Ô∏è

Operators are symbols that specify which operations to perform on operands. Operands are the values or variables that operators act upon. C# provides several types of operators, including:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**
2. **Comparison Operators**
3. **Logical Operators**
4. **Bitwise Operators**
5. **Assignment Operators**
6. **Miscellaneous Operators**

## Arithmetic Operators ‚ûï‚ûñ‚úñÔ∏è‚ûó

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

| Operator | Description              | Example       |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------|
| `+`      | Addition                 | `a + b`       |
| `-`      | Subtraction              | `a - b`       |
| `*`      | Multiplication           | `a * b`       |
| `/`      | Division                 | `a / b`       |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder)      | `a % b`       |
| `++`     | Increment by 1           | `a++` or `++a`|
| `--`     | Decrement by 1           | `a--` or `--a`|

Example:
```csharp
int a = 10;
int b = 5;
int sum = a + b;          // 15
int difference = a - b;   // 5
int product = a * b;      // 50
int quotient = a / b;     // 2
int remainder = a % b;    // 0

a++;                      // a is now 11
b--;                      // b is now 4
```

## Comparison Operators ‚öñÔ∏è

Comparison operators are used to compare two values or expressions. They return a boolean result (`true` or `false`).

| Operator | Description              | Example       |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------|
| `==`     | Equal to                 | `a == b`      |
| `!=`     | Not equal to             | `a != b`      |
| `>`      | Greater than             | `a > b`       |
| `<`      | Less than                | `a < b`       |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `a >= b`      |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    | `a <= b`      |

Example:
```csharp
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
bool isEqual = (x == y);       // false
bool isNotEqual = (x != y);    // true
bool isGreater = (x > y);      // false
bool isLess = (x < y);         // true
bool isGreaterOrEqual = (x >= y); // false
bool isLessOrEqual = (x <= y); // true
```

## Logical Operators üîó

Logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions or values and return a boolean result.

| Operator | Description              | Example       |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------|
| `&&`     | Logical AND              | `a && b`      |
| `||`     | Logical OR               | `a || b`      |
| `!`      | Logical NOT              | `!a`          |

Example:
```csharp
bool condition1 = (5 > 3);    // true
bool condition2 = (10 < 20);  // true

bool resultAnd = condition1 && condition2;  // true (both conditions are true)
bool resultOr = condition1 || condition2;   // true (at least one condition is true)
bool resultNot = !condition1;               // false (negates the condition1)
```

## Bitwise Operators üîß

Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits of integer values.

| Operator | Description              | Example       |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------|
| `&`      | Bitwise AND              | `a & b`       |
| `|`      | Bitwise OR               | `a | b`       |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR              | `a ^ b`       |
| `~`      | Bitwise NOT              | `~a`          |
| `<<`     | Left shift               | `a << 2`      |
| `>>`     | Right shift              | `a >> 2`      |

Example:
```csharp
int a = 6;  // 0110 in binary
int b = 3;  // 0011 in binary

int andResult = a & b;    // 0010 (2 in decimal)
int orResult = a | b;     // 0111 (7 in decimal)
int xorResult = a ^ b;    // 0101 (5 in decimal)
int notResult = ~a;       // 1001 (inverts bits)
int leftShift = a << 1;   // 1100 (12 in decimal)
int rightShift = a >> 1;  // 0011 (3 in decimal)
```

## Assignment Operators üìù

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can also be combined with other operators to perform an operation and assignment simultaneously.

| Operator | Description                   | Example       |
|----------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| `=`      | Assign                        | `a = b`       |
| `+=`     | Add and assign                | `a += b`      |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign           | `a -= b`      |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign           | `a *= b`      |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign             | `a /= b`      |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign            | `a %= b`      |
| `&=`     | Bitwise AND and assign        | `a &= b`      |
| `|=`     | Bitwise OR and assign         | `a |= b`      |
| `^=`     | Bitwise XOR and assign        | `a ^= b`      |
| `<<=`    | Left shift and assign         | `a <<= b`     |
| `>>=`    | Right shift and assign        | `a >>= b`     |

Example:
```csharp
int a = 10;
a += 5;    // a is now 15
a -= 3;    // a is now 12
a *= 2;    // a is now 24
a /= 4;    // a is now 6
a %= 4;    // a is now 2

int b = 5;
b &= 3;    // b is now 1 (bitwise AND and assign)
b |= 2;    // b is now 3 (bitwise OR and assign)
b ^= 1;    // b is now 2 (bitwise XOR and assign)
b <<= 1;   // b is now 4 (left shift and assign)
b >>= 1;   // b is now 2 (right shift and assign)
```

## Miscellaneous Operators üõ†Ô∏è

### Conditional (Ternary) Operator ‚ùì

The ternary operator is a shorthand for the `if-else` statement. It takes three operands: a condition, a value if the condition is true, and a value if the condition is false.

Syntax:
```csharp
condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
```

Example:
```csharp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int max = (a > b) ? a : b;  // max is 20
```

### Null-Coalescing Operator ‚ùì‚ùì

The null-coalescing operator `??` is used to provide a default value when dealing with nullable types or reference types.

Example:
```csharp
string str = null;
string result = str ?? "Default Value";  // result is "Default Value"
```

### Null-Conditional Operator ‚ùì.

The null-conditional operator `?.` is used to safely access members of an object that might be null.

Example:
```csharp
string str = null;
int? length = str?.Length;  // length is null
```

## Expressions üßÆ

An expression is a combination of operators and operands that produces a value. Expressions can range from simple arithmetic operations to complex calculations involving multiple operators.

### Simple Expressions

Example:
```csharp
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
int c = a + b;  // c is 15
```

### Complex Expressions

Example:
```csharp
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
int result = (x + y) * (x - y) / 2;  // result is -150
```

## Operator Precedence and Associativity üìè

Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Associativity determines the order in which operators of the same precedence level are evaluated.

### Precedence

Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.

### Precedence

| Operator               | Description                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `()`                   | Parentheses                       |
| `++` `--`              | Post-increment and post-decrement |
| `*` `/` `%`            | Multiplication, division, modulus |
| `+` `-`                | Addition, subtraction             |
| `<<` `>>`              | Left shift, right shift           |
| `<` `<=` `>` `>=`      | Comparison operators              |
| `==` `!=`              | Equality operators                |
| `&`                    | Bitwise AND                       |
| `^`                    | Bitwise XOR                       |
| `|`                    | Bitwise OR                        |
| `&&`                   | Logical AND                       |
| `||`                   | Logical OR                        |
| `?:`                   | Conditional (ternary) operator    |
| `=`, `+=`, `-=` etc.   | Assignment operators              |

### Associativity

- **Left Associative**: Operators evaluate from left to right.
- **Right Associative**: Operators evaluate from right to left.

Example:
```csharp
int result = 10 + 5 * 2;  // result is 20 (multiplication (*) has higher precedence)
```

### Operator Overloading

In C#, some operators can be overloaded, meaning they can be redefined for custom types.

Example:
```csharp
public class ComplexNumber
{
    public int Real { get; set; }
    public int Imaginary { get; set; }
    
    public static ComplexNumber operator +(ComplexNumber c1, ComplexNumber c2)
    {
        return new ComplexNumber
        {
            Real = c1.Real + c2.Real,
            Imaginary = c1.Imaginary + c2.Imaginary
        };
    }
}

ComplexNumber num1 = new ComplexNumber { Real = 1, Imaginary = 2 };
ComplexNumber num2 = new ComplexNumber { Real = 3, Imaginary = 4 };
ComplexNumber sum = num1 + num2;  // Calls the overloaded + operator
```

## Implicit and Explicit Conversions üîÑ

### Implicit Conversion

C# allows certain conversions between compatible types without explicit casting.

Example:
```csharp
int intValue = 10;
double doubleValue = intValue;  // Implicit conversion from int to double
```

### Explicit Conversion (Casting)

Explicit casting is required when converting between incompatible types.

Example:
```csharp
double doubleValue = 3.14;
int intValue = (int)doubleValue;  // Explicit conversion from double to int
```

### Type Conversion Methods

Use methods like `Convert.ToInt32()` or `int.Parse()` for conversions between types like string and numeric.

Example:
```csharp
string strNumber = "123";
int num = int.Parse(strNumber);  // Convert string to int
```

## Operator Precedence and Evaluation Order üß†

Understanding operator precedence and evaluation order is crucial for writing correct and efficient code. Always use parentheses to clarify your intentions when needed.
